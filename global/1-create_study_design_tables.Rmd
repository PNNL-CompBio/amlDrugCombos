data_package_num <- 3606
```

```{r}
job_records <- get_job_records_by_dataset_package(data_package_num)

Samples and fractions table must be created from study-specific metadata. See `r help(read_study_design)` for more information.

```{r}

samples <- study_design$samples
references <- study_design$references
```
